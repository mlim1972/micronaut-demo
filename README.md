# Micronaut Demo Project
## Background
The purpose of this project is to have a reference project using [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io). 
The repo contains branches that will build from the previous branches and add new features. Each
of the branches will be prefixed with _**{mn-version}-{branch-order}-{feature}**_.

```
mn-version   -> This reflects the version on micronaut used
branch-order -> Numeric value to reflect a particular order
feature      -> Name of the feature the branch
```
